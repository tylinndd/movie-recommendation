# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

My love and passion for film drove me to build a machine learning-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on movie genres, cast, description, and director. Built as part of a learning project to explore recommender systems and data science techniques, I plan to add more functionalities and features as my knowledge grows.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Content-based filtering  
- Collaborative filtering (user/item-based)  
- Hybrid recommendation model  
- Movie metadata analysis (genres, cast, directors, etc.)  
- Interactive user interface  
- Visualizations of recommendation results  

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask  
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS 
- Scikit-learn
- Bash
